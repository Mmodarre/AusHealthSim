# Test Failures Summary

1. The models don't have the enhanced attributes we're testing
2. The data generation modules exist but don't have the methods we're testing
3. Some file paths in the tests don't match the actual file locations

## Next Steps:

1. Update the models to include enhanced attributes
2. Implement the required methods in the data generation modules
3. Fix the file paths in the tests

This is normal for a test-driven development approach, where tests are written first and then the implementation follows.
