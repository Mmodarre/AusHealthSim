# Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview

The Health Insurance Simulation project has been thoroughly reorganized to improve code structure, maintainability, and adherence to Python best practices. This document summarizes the changes made.

## Directory Structure Changes

### New Top-Level Directories

- `bin/` - Shell scripts (moved from root)
- `config/` - Configuration files (centralized)
- `data/` - Data files (centralized)
- `scripts/` - Standalone Python scripts (moved from root)
  - `db/` - Database-related scripts
  - `simulation/` - Simulation-related scripts
  - `utils/` - Utility scripts

### Enhanced Package Structure

- `health_insurance_au/` - Main Python package
  - `api/` - API endpoints (new)
  - `cli/` - Command-line interfaces (new)
  - `core/` - Core business logic and constants (new)
  - `db/` - Database-specific code (new)
  - `integration/` - Integration with external systems (existing)
  - `models/` - Data models (existing)
  - `simulation/` - Simulation modules (existing)
  - `utils/` - Utility functions (existing)

## New Files

- `setup.py` - Package installation configuration
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python packaging configuration
- `MANIFEST.in` - Package distribution file inclusion
- `LICENSE` - MIT License file
- `Makefile` - Common development tasks
- `.gitattributes` - Git file handling configuration
- `health_insurance_au/core/constants.py` - Australian-specific constants
- `health_insurance_au/cli/initialize_db.py` - CLI for database initialization
- `health_insurance_au/db/cdc.py` - CDC-specific code (moved from utils)
- `health_insurance_au/db/utils.py` - Database utilities (moved from utils)
- `config/logging.conf` - Logging configuration
- `config/simulation.conf` - Simulation parameters
- Various README.md files in subdirectories

## Root Directory Files

The root directory now contains only essential project files:

- `README.md` - Project overview and documentation
- `LICENSE` - MIT License file
- `MANIFEST.in` - Package distribution file inclusion
- `Makefile` - Common development tasks
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python packaging configuration
- `setup.py` - Package installation configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration
- `.gitattributes` - Git file handling configuration

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Clean Root Directory**
   - Only essential project files in the root directory
   - Easy to navigate and understand project structure

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear distinction between package code, scripts, and configuration
   - Better organization of related functionality

3. **Improved Installability**
   - Project can now be installed with pip
   - Command-line tools available after installation

4. **Better Configuration Management**
   - Centralized configuration in the config directory
   - Support for multiple environments

5. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Logical grouping of related files
   - Better documentation with README files in each directory

6. **Standardized Python Packaging**
   - Follows modern Python packaging practices
   - Supports both development and distribution

7. **Development Workflow**
   - Makefile for common development tasks
   - Consistent testing and linting configuration

## Next Steps

1. Update imports in all Python files to reflect the new structure
2. Update shell scripts to reference the new file locations
3. Add more CLI modules for other operations
4. Enhance documentation to reflect the new structure
5. Consider adding type hints to improve code quality
